		<h3>Nova</h3>
		<p>Nova lives with Megan Pallatin in Indianapolis, IN and is co-owned with WildAbout Whippets! which means he gets to spend all sorts of time wih his sister, Fig. Nova has certainly been the super star of the litter by finishing his WRCh in just a few meets and has most of his ORC points.  Nova isn't satisfied with racing alone, so he picked up dock diving as a hobby and placed first in the Junior Division in his very first competiton.  Nova certainly takes after his mama when it comes to trying new activities... anything goes!  Nova has a soft spot in all of our hearts as he reminds us so much of Grandpa Zeeno.</p>
